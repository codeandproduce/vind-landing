						My name is Chan Woo Kim, some prefer Jon, and I am from South Korea. I am a senior in Shanghai American School, Puxi Campus, set to graduate on June 2019. I am a big nerd! With a finsta full of math related quirky content and as an avid Redditor, I am known to be passionate about lots of things and to love spreading new things to those around me.
						
						<br/><br/>
						At school, I'm the Vice President of Science National Honor Society, Founder and President of Developers' Hub, where I teach over 15 students elements of software engineering through web development and Git, Public Relations Officer of the National Honor Society, a link crew leader, a member of Mu Alpha Theta and National English Honor Society, a sprinter in <a href="https://recruit-match.ncsasports.org/clientrms/athletes/5154212">Varsity Track & Field</a>, and a Winger for the Varsity Rugby team.

							I am looking for partnerships in safety and security, especially in data collection, for Vind. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:chanwookim@vindmaps.com">chanwookim@vindmaps.com</a> if you are interested.</br></br>

							I am the CEO & CTO of <a href="http://vindmaps.com/">Vind</a>. Vind started when I had an idea for a start-up that I believed (and still believe) might really change the way people deal with safety today. I've formed a team since then and we all have been working very hard to create our product. As the CEO, I oversee all operations of the company and make executive decisions. As the CTO, I am in charge of the entirety of product development, namely developing the app.

						<p class="section-description">
							I am looking for mentorship in the area of sexual assult prevention, health tracking, and Apple WatchOS Development for Alertive. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:team@alertive.co">team@alertive.co</a> if you are interested.</br></br>

							<a href="http://alertive.co">Alertive</a> was incubated & founded at the LaunchX 2018 (formerly MIT Launch) Entrepreneurship Program @ University of Pennsylvnia. At the program, we identified a <u><i>problem</i></u>: a vast majority of people taking care of those with health conditions were in costant fear of what will happen to them.
							</br></br>
							Alertive was founded to solve this issue. Alertive is a company aimed at using Deep Learning to detect screams in audio data and anomalies in health data in order to provide instant notifications for those in critical conditions such as sexual assults and heart attacks.
							</br></br>
							As the Executive Officer & Technology Officer of Alertive, I make executive decisions and I am in charge of the entirety of the product development.

						My research interests include: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GANs, making sense of the learning inside the black-box, and Hierarchal Temporal Memory<br/><br/>
						I am currently involved in A.I. Music research at NYU Shanghai with Dr. Gus Xia to create a generative model for music.
						<br/><br/>
						I've also conducted research as an entry to the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. The purpose of the project was to use NLP methods (Text Vectorization, N-Grams, TF-IDF, Linear SVMs optimized using both Coordinate & Gradient Descent) on Windows API System Calls to detect malware. Our model achieved a highest of 96% accuracy. The project won the 4th place Grand Award at Intel ISEF and special awards from numerous organizations (e.g. CAST, MAWHIBA).<br/><br/>
						The paper can be found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05412"> <i>
(arXiv) NtMalDetect: A Machine Learning Approach to Malware Detection Using Native API System Calls</i></a>
						<br/><br/>
						I self-studied Linear Algebra and Multivariable calculus on top of finishing AP Calculus BC at school and finished Andrew Ng's courses to make all this happen. I am now comfortable with much of the theoretical foundations as well as using TensorFlow and other Python modules.

						Making apps was how I got into computer science in the beginning back in middle school. Today, I work with: <br/><br/>

						I've created apps and websites for personal projects as well as for companies. I've also created open source projects.
